Hi! 👋  
I'm Bernardo.

I’m 35, originally from Brazil, but I've had the privilege of calling Vancouver home for almost 10 years now.  
I live here with my beautiful wife and precious daughter, both of whom are the reason I wake up every morning and breathe with purpose.  
My family has been in the hotel business in Brazil for generations. While I've always had a deep passion for technology, I never had the opportunity to pursue my professional dreams. Instead, I worked in the hotel industry, focusing my studies on tourism, property management, and customer care.

Every time I flirted with the idea of becoming a tech professional, the responsibilities of adulthood and family pressures seemed to hit me with a massive "NO."  
But life has a way of surprising us, and it presented me with the greatest gift I could ever ask for: my wife.  
She is the person who not only inspires me to become the best version of myself but also supports my dreams with unwavering strength and love.

To my family, I promise this profile won’t be loading for much longer. I am determined, and this journey is just beginning.
